ABOUT:
JsHttpRequest library (LGPL license) elaborates data loading with AJAX (Remote Scripting) method.
Here is a short list of its most interest features and differences from analogs:
* Cross-browser compatibility. Library works with IE5.0+, Mozilla 1.7+, FireFox 1.0+, Opera 7.3+,
  Safari ("+" means "in specified and newer versions").
  By this token, code could work without ActiveX and XMLHttpRequest support
  (but if these capabilities are avalilable, they are used automatically).
* File uploads from user browser to the server without page reloading.
* Multi-dimensional data structures exchange (JSON analog) in client request and server responce.
* Optimal data loading method choosing (XMLHttpRequest, Microsoft.XMLHTTP, <SCRIPT>, <IFRAME>)
  depending on current browser. In particular, ability to load data from foreign hosts.
* Interface is compatible with XMLHttpRequest.
